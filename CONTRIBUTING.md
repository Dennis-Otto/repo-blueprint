# Contributing

Contributions are welcome through issues and pull requests.
Participation follows [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and project decision-making is described in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).
Use [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) to choose the correct public support channel and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reports.

All changes reach the protected `main` branch through pull requests that pass every required check.

## Requirements for changes

- Changes need tests, and the checks of `scripts/check.sh` pass.
- Every commit carries a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off, `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`, which `git commit -s` adds.
- Name the issue that a pull request fixes with `Fixes #123` in its description. The issue stays open until a release ships the fix and then closes with a link to the release.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, so we can agree on the approach.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Describe what changes for users under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md`, in the words of a user.
4. Open a pull request whose title is a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), such as `feat(settings): add a dark mode` or `fix: keep the token secret`. Mark a breaking change with `!`. Pull requests are squashed into one commit named after the title, and the title decides the next version: `fix` a patch, `feat` a minor, `!` a major version.

## Checks

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.txt
. .venv/bin/activate && bash scripts/check.sh
```

To run them before every push on its own, turn on the hook of the repository once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The dev container in `.devcontainer/` has all of this set up, for VS Code and for GitHub Codespaces: open the repository in it, and `bash scripts/check.sh` runs.

## Releases

The release bot keeps a pull request titled `chore: release x.y.z` with the next version, up to date with `main` and decided anew with every merge. Its section of the changelog is the text of Unreleased; without one, it lists the pull requests. Merging it creates the release with its package, SBOM and signed provenance. New repositories copy the blueprint from its release tags, and the blueprint bot brings every repository made from it up to the new release. A release of dependency updates merges and publishes itself.

A line `Release-As: 2.0.0-beta.1` in the description of a pull request sets the version of the next release, for a prerelease for example. A prerelease keeps the text of Unreleased for the release that follows it.
